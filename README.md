Understandly

A learning platform focused on comprehension, mastery, and real-world application.

🚀 Overview

Understandly is a web application designed to help learners truly understand concepts—not memorize them.
Each lesson includes:

A concept-focused quiz that checks understanding, not rote recall.

A hands-on project that applies what you learned to a real-world scenario.

The mission:
Build job-ready skills through deep comprehension and practical experience.

✨ Why Understandly?

Most educational platforms test what you can remember.
Understandly tests what you can explain, apply, and use.

Unlike platforms such as Khan Academy, Brilliant, or Duolingo, Understandly is designed to challenge learners, encourage active thinking, and push them to implement concepts through real projects—making learning both meaningful and practical.

🔧 Current Features

Simple subject + lesson selection (currently Computer Science only).

A demo lesson with a comprehension-based quiz.

Basic structure for adding future lessons and projects.

Clean, expandable architecture for scaling into advanced topics.

This prototype demonstrates the concept; the long-term plan is to cover complex, university-level subjects that require deep thinking.

🧠 How It’s Different

Other platforms often:

❌ Rely on memorization
❌ Ask repetitive recall-based questions
❌ Offer little real-world application

Understandly instead:

✔ Focuses on conceptual understanding
✔ Challenges users with thoughtful questions
✔ Includes real projects to reinforce skills
✔ Aims to develop job-ready competence

🤖 AI Tools Used

GitHub Copilot — Generated the initial skeleton of the project.

ChatGPT — Helped refine the idea, plan the tech stack, and shape the user experience and app structure.

📚 Roadmap
Phase 1 — CS Core Expansion

Add university-level computer science topics such as:

Data Structures & Algorithms

Operating Systems

Databases

Computer Networks

Software Engineering Principles

Phase 2 — New Subjects

Introduce additional fields:

Mathematics

Physics

Economics

And more…

Content quality will come from studying authoritative resources, expert university lectures, academic events, and (with funding) collaborations with subject-matter experts and professors.

Phase 3 — Platform Growth

Add user accounts and progress tracking

Add AI-powered personalized lesson paths

Add community projects and peer review

Add interactive visualizations and simulations

🛠 Tech Stack (Planned + Actual)

Current:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Basic frontend structure

Planned:

React or Next.js

Node.js or Django backend

Database (PostgreSQL / MongoDB)

Authentication

Full UI/UX redesign
